
STAGE 1 (LEXICAL ANALYZER)

In this phase, a program is given to your code. 
If that program follows the lexical rules, it must print the tokens of that program in the output. 
Otherwise , it must print the appropriate error. 

To make the file

>>>flex Lex_Rule.lex                                      // creates lex.yy.c
>>>g++ -o runner lex.yy.c                                 // creates the nunner.exe file 


To test:
	>>>runner [testfilename]
